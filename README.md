		Call of Duty Comparison
	</h1>

	<p>I have been playing <i>Call of Duty</i> for as long as I can remember.  I have
		every generation of the game all the way from the original <i>Call of Duty</i>
		to the most recent <i>Infinite Warfare</i>.  So here is my opinion on each
		game from the worst to the best:
	</p>
	<h3>
		13. <i>Call of Duty 3 (2006)</i>
	</h3>
	<img src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.M413561379fa2ac3d1d708a399b15e1f5o0&pid=15.1&P=0&w=300&h=300">
	<p>
		Probably my least played game and for good reason.  It pretty much 
		repeated what the 2 games did before with the same World War 2 setting
		and not very much else to offer.  The best part about it was the probably
		the campaign which really is not saying much.
	</p>
	<h3>
		12. <i>Call of Duty: Ghosts</i> (2013)
	</h3>
	<img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.M95741b577a23981c542e4fb6d2e83941o0&pid=15.1&P=0&w=248&h=156">
	<p>
		Easily the most hated game in the COD (Call of Duty) community.  I think people
		really give this game more heat than it deserved; I mean it was fun and
		playable to an extent but the game, just like the the one above, offfered
		nothing that hadn't been done 3 times before by the Modern Warfare series.
		It also had a very forgettable campaign.
	</p>
	<h3>
		11. <i>Call of Duty: 2</i> (2005)
	</h3>
	<img src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.M101a35b01e82f5fcf54b6b33dcf1ea8co0&pid=15.1&P=0&w=263&h=183">
	<p>
		Not too much to say on this one.  Just a much improved version of the
		game preceding it.  First game I really got into as a kid.
	</p>
	<h3>
		10. <i>Call of Duty</i> (2003)
	</h3>
	<img src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Maf97dc55604bebdb2f8a1573e4cbf4efo0&pid=15.1&P=0&w=286&h=161">
	<p>
		Considering playability compared to the other COD games out there it
		is probably the least playable and fun, however since this game is what
		started off the franchise and was revolutionary at the time of its
		release it deserves some respect.  Campaign was admirable.
	</p>
	<h3>
		9. <i>Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare</i>
	</h3>
	<img src="http://www.hardcoregamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Call-of-Duty-Infinite-Warfare.jpg"
	height="250" width="500">
	<p>
		Contains the same type of jetpack controlled movement that I love about 
		Black Ops 3 (the game preceding it), however it is pretty much just copy of
		the game with maps that all seem like slight tweeks of maps from earlier
		games.  The game contains a few new features as far as guns and killstreaks
		and introduced a health bar which isn't seen in any other.  Not too sure
		how I feel about that though lol.  Decent campaign.
	</p>
	<h3>
		8. <i>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</i> (2014)
	</h3>
	<img src="http://www.ps4france.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Call-of-Duty-Advanced-Warfare.png"
	height="250" width="500">
	<p>
		There really is a lot I could talk about concerning this game.  It completely
		changed the movement in the game from fighting on more of 2 dimensional
		plane to 3 dimensions.  I say that because the game introduced boost jumping
		or jetpacks in a sense.  It is a cool dimension to the game but with
		everyone jumping around it just got too hectic and crazy to understand
		what going on.  It invented a new type of zombies, the 4th generation of
		zombies but it failed miserably.  Easily the worst game of zombies.
		Campaign was fun though.
	</p>
	<h3>
		7. <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops</i> (2010)
	</h3>	
	<img src="http://cdn01.wallconvert.com/_media/conv/1/9/82077-call-of-duty-black-ops.jpg"
	height="250" width="500">
	<p>
		The lower rating of this game will be extremely controversial to die hard
		COD fans but I never took a particular liking to this game.  It was fun
		but it just didn't really captivate me like some of the others on this list.
		Everyone compliments this game for having the best Campaign and Zombies, 
		but I just was not a fan of it plain and simple.
	</p>
	<h3>
		6. <i>Call of Duty: World at War</i>(2008)
	</h3>
	<img src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.M0a999aaf45bb4f84d6edae1a1a8d4660o0&pid=15.1&P=0&w=289&h=163">
	<img src="http://static.planetminecraft.com/files/resource_media/screenshot/1228/nazi-zombies_2846953.jpg"
	height="200" width="350" style="float:right">
	<p>
		Reintroduced the World War 2 environvent in a brilliant way a year after 
		the extremely successful <i>Modern Warfare</i>.  The campaign was very
		fun and the game introduced one of the franchises most defining and fun
		game modes: <b>NAZI ZOMBIES</b>.  Some people will buy COD games just
		for the zombies mode because of how entertaining it is.  In my opinion 
		the multiplayer was aggravating and not much fun but just because this
		game introduces zombies lands it at 8.
	</p>
	<h3>
		5. <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</i> (2011)
	</h3>
	<img src="http://www.thejabberlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_3_wallpaper.jpg"
	height="250" width="500">
	<p>
		The only game I went to the midnight release for.  No one in the 
		COD community is very enthusiastic about this game, however I <b>LOVED</b>
		the multiplayer in this game.  Arguably my most played game and as far
		as KDR (Kill to Death Ratio), my second best game.  It provided a decent
		ending to one of the most iconic campaigns in gaming history.  The
		special ops part in the game was fun but nothing to gloat about.  Overall
		loved the maps and the guns, and the killstreaks were alright.
	</p>
	<h3>
		4. <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</i> (2012)
	</h3>
	<img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GnnGfzcPg6c/UKn6Rr2xmRI/AAAAAAAAAPI/0dqtdsKwtS8/s1600/call+of+duty+black+ops+2+hd+wallpaper+(15).jpg"
	height="250" width="500">
	<p>
		As far as the multiplayer goes my 3rd favorite game.  A few of the maps 
		will forever go down in history as my favorite maps.  The zombies in 
		this game are my favorite to date which will come as serious controversy
		to many due to the all the hate surrounding certain maps in the zombies mode.
		I can see why people didn't like it but it contained just enough complexity
		and challenge to constantly keep you on your feet.
	</p>
	<h3>
		3. <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i> (2007)
	</h3>
	<img src="https://assets.vg247.com/current/2016/09/Modern-Warfare.jpg"
	height="250" width="500">
	<p>
		The defining game for the COD franchise.  This is the game that really made
		Call of Duty explode into the extremely successful franchise it is today.
		The game had introduced a modern setting as opposed the WW2 that previous
		games used.  The game had amazing gameplay and really set the stage for 
		all modern warfare type games for years to come. The campaign contained
		the most ground breaking and exciting missions ever kicking off one the most
		iconic campaigns in video game history.
	</p>
	<h3>
		2. <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</i> (2015)
	</h3>
	<img src="http://assets.vg247.com/current/2015/04/black_ops_3.jpg"
	height="250" width="500">
	<p>
		Probably ties Modern Warfare 3 with the most time spent playing a particular
		game.  This was easily the game I was best at by far containing my highest
		KDR.  The only game that I ever attained Master Prestige in.  Overall I 
		just loved the gameplay, the movement, the maps and the guns.  It took 
		the boosting idea from Advanced Warfare and made a few tweeks that made
		the movement and jumping fantastic.  It took all the havok and craziness 
		out of the single boost jumping and made it more controlled.  It also added
		wall running which is a blast.  Campaign was fun and the zombies were too.  
		Only reason it wasn't my favorite zombies is because the maps and features
		got too complicated.  It would take hours and hours to completely understand
		each map.  But overall, a terrific game.
	</p>
	<h3>
		1. <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: 2</i> (2009)
	</h3>
	<img src="http://storiesbywilliams.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/modernwarfare2.jpg"
	height="250" width="500">
	<p>
		With out a doubt everyone's favorite game in the franchise.  It was hard
		to follow such an amazing game like Modern Warfare, but the developers 
		nailed it.  As far a multiplayer goes it is not my favorite but the maps,
		the guns and the revolutionary kill streaks makes it hard not to like
		this game.  Prior to this game kill streak were always the same: 3-5-7.
		But this game introduced a huge variety of kill streaks to run that made
		the game so fun. However if you weren't running Harrier, AC130/Chopper Gunner,
		and Nuke; then you were a scrub lol.  The campaign actually topped that of
		the preceding which was extremely difficult to, and it contained missions
		that no one will ever forget like "No Russian".  The Special Ops of the
		game offered a Co Op play that my brother and I still will occasionally 
		play today due how entertaining and replayable some of the missions are.
